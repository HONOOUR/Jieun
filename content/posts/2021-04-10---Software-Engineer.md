**_Great developers who have achieved success_**

1. They work proactively.
2. They contribute to the developers’ community - they may be role models for us also because of their work in the public domain.
3. They have a growth mindset - they know that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work — brains and talent are just the starting point.
4. They are fantastic communicators.

**_List of the things you can apply to your routine_**

1. Ask specific questions.
2. Be transparent and honest.
3. Be aware of your own limitations and don’t hesitate to ask for help.
4. Think about the consequences - sometimes it’s better for you to NOT implement a given feature. Deploy things you’re able to handle.
5. Be there for your team. If you can contribute right now, don’t wait — do it.
6. Test your code.
7. If there is a rule for something, follow it — it’s there for a reason.
8. Don’t pretend that you can’t see a flaw in your software. Know when to dig deeper as opposed to delivering a “good enough” feature.
9. Be positive.
10. Think about yourself as a real end user of the feature.

> Knowledge, Cognitive and Interpretation Skills.
> Being a professional in a rapidly evolving field means you need to continually invest in learning new skills, technologies, practices, and tools. Be on the lookout for them by reading professional magazines (including this one), attending conferences, studying classic books as well as new ones, and examining other people’s code (open source software makes excellent such material). Look for aspects of your and your organization’s work that can be improved, and be ready to learn and experiment with new methods to address the shortcomings.
