combines [columns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column_(database)) from one or more [tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_(database)) into a new table

## AS statement

display column with new name 

## INNER JOINS

results with the set of records that match in both tables

```sql
// result of customers who had a transaction
SELECT payment_id, payment.customer_id, first_name 
FROM customer 
INNER JOIN payment
ON customer.customer_id = payment.customer_id;
```

## OUTER JOINS

### FULL OUTER JOINS

grabs everything

```sql
SELECT * FROM customer
FULL OUTER JOIN payment
ON customer.customer_id = payment.customer_id
WHERE customer.customer_id IS null
OR payment.payment_id IS null;
```

### LEFT OUTER JOIN

results in the set of records in the left table(from the match with right table)

```sql
// order matters!
// films are not in our inventory (use case)
SELECT film.film_id, title, inventory_id, store_id FROM film
LEFT OUTER JOIN inventory
ON inventory.film_id = film.film_id
WHERE inventory.film_id IS null
```

### RIGHT OUTER JOIN

results in the set of records in the right table(from the match with left table)

```sql
// order matters!
// films are not in our inventory (use case)
SELECT film.film_id, title, inventory_id, store_id FROM inventory
RIGHT OUTER JOIN film
ON inventory.film_id = film.film_id
WHERE film.film_id IS null
```

**Examples**

1. It works, but use outer join when you need every information (by using WHERE customer.address_id IS null OR address.address_id IS null

```sql
SELECT district, email from address
FULL OUTER JOIN customer
ON address.address_id = customer.address_id
WHERE address.district = 'California';
```

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, film_id FROM actor
INNER JOIN film_actor
ON actor.actor_id = film_actor.actor_id;
```

1. Two joins

```sql
SELECT title, first_name, last_name FROM actor
INNER JOIN film_actor 
ON actor.actor_id = film_actor.actor_id
INNER JOIN film
ON film_actor.film_id = film.film_id
WHERE actor.first_name = 'Nick' AND actor.last_name = 'Wahlberg'
```
